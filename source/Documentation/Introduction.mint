          <p>"Mint UI is following these principles:"</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>"Form follows function"</strong>
              " - The function of the UI defines its looks and not the other way around."
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>"Consistent"</strong>
              " - The UI is consistent across screen sizes and applications."
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>"Composable"</strong>

              " - A component (smallest building block) is used to build " \
              "other components, UIs and applications using composition."
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>"Adaptive"</strong>
              " - The UI adapts to screen size fully not just by rearranging the contents."
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>"Extensible"</strong>
              " - It will always possible to create components for Mint UI that fit its design."
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>"Build to last"</strong>
              " - Neither the components themselves or the design will change drastically in the decades to come."
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>"Data first"</strong>
              " - The UI adapts to the screen size based on data."
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>"Free"</strong>
              " - Mint UI is and always will be free for individuals and small companies."
            </li>
          </ul>

              <strong>"Themeable"</strong>
